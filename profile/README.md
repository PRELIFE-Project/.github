## Project mission

PRELIFE is an interdisciplinary research consortium aiming to unravel two profound questions: *How did life originate on Earth?* and *How common might life‐favourable conditions be elsewhere in the universe?*  
We bring together experts from astronomy, chemistry, biology, computer science, earth & planetary sciences, mathematics, physics, education, and more to collaborate across disciplinary boundaries.   
In addition to cutting‐edge research, we actively engage teachers, students, and the public via educational programs, artistic collaborations, and museum partnerships.

## Funding & Institutional Support

- PRELIFE is supported by the **Origins Center**. 
- Core funding comes via **NWO / NWA** (Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research / National Research Agenda)
    - Grant Number: {to be filled out}

---

## Structure & Research Projects

The consortium features **15 research projects**, ranging from laboratory experiments to computer modelling, theoretical frameworks, planetary science, cosmochemistry, and educational outreach.  
Examples include:  
- Experimental petrology and zircon geochemistry  
- Numerical modeling of magma oceans and planetary differentiation  
- Origins of self-replicating systems and protocell formation  
- Theoretical approaches to emergent life and information processing  
- Educational development to bring origin-of-life concepts into classrooms

## README Purpose & Scope

This organization hosts (or will host) code, models, simulations, data pipelines, and educational tools developed under the PRELIFE umbrella. This README is intended to:

- Inform contributors and visitors about the project’s goals and funding  
- Set expectations around code standards, contribution norms, license, etc.  
- Serve as a landing page for linking to individual project repositories

## Code & Collaboration Standards (Suggested)

Below is a suggested baseline to keep the project coherent, maintainable, and inclusive. You may adapt per subproject.

| Topic | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| **Repository structure** | Use one repo per major work package or subproject. Keep root README pointing to child repos. |
| **License** | Prefer an open science / open source license (e.g. MIT, GPL-3.0, Apache 2.0, or CC for data). Clarify code vs data licensing. |
| **Coding style** | Follow PEP 8 for Python, or comparable canonical style for other languages. |
| **Dependencies** | Use environment specification (e.g. `requirements.txt`, `environment.yml`, `poetry.lock`) for reproducibility. |
| **Version control & branching** | Use feature branches. Require pull requests and code review. Keep `main` (or `master`) stable. |
| **Documentation** | Each subrepo should include its own README, CITATION.cff, example usage, and where possible demos. |
| **Data & large files** | Use data repositories or dedicated storage (e.g. Zenodo, institutional storage, etc.) and avoid uploading/commiting data into git. |
| **Citation & attribution** | Provide citation instructions (e.g. DOI) and acknowledge supporting partners (Origins Center, NWO / NWA). |
| **Community & governance** | Maintain a CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CONTRIBUTING guide, and clear roles (maintainers, contributors, leads). |

## How to Get Involved

1. Browse the individual project repos (links forthcoming).  
2. Check open issues or “good first issue” tags.  
3. Submit pull requests or propose new modules/ideas.  
4. Engage with the wider community—public outreach, educational modules, or collaborative modelling.
